"""
Diagnostic for the DeepSeek decode path producing nan non-deterministically.

Observation that motivated this file: test_decode_path_matches_reference[deepseek]
passed on one run and returned nan on the next, with no change to the numerics in
between. Mixtral, whose forward_one_token does not touch the shared-expert kernels,
stayed clean at ~9e-4 on both runs.

That pattern is the signature of a kernel that does not write every element of its
output buffer. fused_dequant_up_proj_triton allocates x1/x3 with torch.empty, so any
element the kernel skips keeps whatever the caching allocator left there -- benign
numbers on one run, nan on the next.

These tests deliberately fill freed memory with nan first, so an unwritten element
shows up as nan every time instead of once in a while, then walk the decode path
stage by stage to find which kernel is responsible.
